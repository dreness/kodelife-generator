KodeLife Manual

#### Preferences · General

* * *

##### Language

Global language setting for all of KodeLife's user interface. Needs a restart of the application to be applied.

* * *

##### Window Layout

Determines the layout used for [Editor](interface-editor.md) and [Output](interface-output.md) in KodeLife's main window.

- **Stack** Overlay the code editor on top of the master output view.
- **Split Vertical** Vertically divide the code editor and master output view areas.
- **Split Horizontal** Horizontally divide the code editor and master output view areas.

* * *

##### Graphics API

Selection of Graphics API (OpenGL, Metal, DirectX, etc.) and some information about the currently active renderer and driver.

* * *

##### User interface scale

Global scaling factor for all of KodeLife's user interface. Needs a restart of the application to be applied.

**Note:** This is an experimental feature and may cause some user interface controls to behave or render unpredictably.

* * *

##### Automatically check for updates

Automatically contact the hexler.net website to check for an updated version of the application on startup, at most once a day.

**Note** that no additional information about the application or your system other than the operating system type and architecture will be transmitted to the website during this check.

* * *

##### Send anonymous usage statistics

This enables sending of anonymous usage statistics back to the hexler.net website.

This may include data about your system and use of the application, such as operating system, version and language, hardware specifics such as amount of RAM and number of CPU cores, type of GPU, graphics API and others.

We use this anonymous data to determine the future direction of the application's design and the viability of continued support for less popular hardware/software configurations. Therefore, we strongly recommend leaving this setting enabled to help us make informed decisions about the application's future.

For more information see our [Privacy Policy](https://hexler.net/privacy-policy).

* * *

##### Enable debug logging

This will cause the application to log a much larger amount of information about its internal operation.

**Note:** This will most certainly cause significant overhead and slow down, and is only encouraged when asked to do so by one of our developers or support staff and only while diagnosing a problem.

The **Show logs** button will open the operating system's file browser at the location of KodeLife's log files.
